Welcome to MSPypeline's documentation!
======================================

``mspypeline`` is a package for analysing proteomic data.
The source code is available on `github <https://github.com/siheming/mspypeline/>`__.

Usage
=====
| The ``mspypeline`` was developed to consolidate the proteomics data analysis workflow while providing both simplicity
  and flexibility to the user.
| Designed with an intuitive and concise graphical user interface (GUI), the ``mspypeline`` offers researchers,
  unfamiliar with programming or data analysis, the opportunity to explore and visualize their data independently and in
  a time-effective manner. Simultaneously, the more experienced user may interact closer with the ``mspypeline`` to
  perform advanced analysis leveraging the plethora of customization options.
| Thus, the ``mspypeline`` provides a platform that supports users in their proteomics data analysis by giving insight
  into the data, offering parameter adaptation when needed, generating custom figures and by reaching biologically
  relevant conclusions through differential expression analysis and hypothesis testing.
